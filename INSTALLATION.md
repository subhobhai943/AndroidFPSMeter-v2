## Permission Setup

### Required Permissions:

1. **System Alert Window (Overlay Permission):**
   - This is the most critical permission for the app to function
   - When you first launch the app, it will request this permission
   - You'll be redirected to system settings to grant overlay permission

2. **Notification Permission (Android 13+):**
   - Required for the foreground service notification
   - The app will request this automatically on Android 13 and above

### Step-by-step Permission Grant:

1. **Launch the FPS Meter app**
2. **Tap "Grant Permission"** when prompted
3. **In the system settings:**
   - Find "FPS Meter" in the app list
   - Toggle "Permit drawing over other apps" to ON
   - Press back to return to the app
4. **The app should now show "Ready to start FPS monitoring"**

## Usage Instructions

### Starting FPS Monitoring:

1. **Open the FPS Meter app**
2. **Tap "Start FPS Meter"**
3. **A notification will appear** indicating the service is running
4. **The FPS overlay will appear** on your screen (usually top-right corner)
5. **Open any game or app** to monitor its FPS

### Understanding the FPS Display:

- **Green numbers**: FPS â‰¥ 55 (Excellent performance)
- **Yellow numbers**: FPS 30-54 (Good performance)
- **Red numbers**: FPS < 30 (Poor performance)

### Stopping FPS Monitoring:

1. **Return to the FPS Meter app**
2. **Tap "Stop FPS Meter"**
3. **The overlay will disappear** and the service will stop

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start:
- Ensure your device runs Android 5.0 or higher
- Check if the APK is corrupted and re-download
- Clear app data and try again

### Permission Issues:
- Go to Settings > Apps > FPS Meter > Permissions
- Ensure "Display over other apps" is enabled
- Some devices may have additional overlay restrictions

### Overlay Not Showing:
- Check if the overlay permission is granted
- Restart the app after granting permissions
- Some devices may have power saving modes that interfere

### Inaccurate FPS Readings:
- The FPS shown is for the system UI, not necessarily the game
- Some games may have their own FPS limiting
- Device performance can affect readings

### Battery Optimization:
- Some devices may kill the background service
- Go to Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization
- Find "FPS Meter" and set it to "Don't optimize"

## Testing with Games

### Popular Games to Test:
- **BGMI (Battlegrounds Mobile India)**
- **PUBG Mobile**
- **Call of Duty Mobile**
- **Genshin Impact**
- **Free Fire**
- **Any graphics-intensive game**

### Expected Results:
- Modern flagship devices: 60-120 FPS in most games
- Mid-range devices: 30-60 FPS depending on game settings
- Older devices: 20-30 FPS in demanding games

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check this troubleshooting guide first
2. Create an issue on GitHub with device details and error description
3. Include Android version, device model, and steps to reproduce

## Advanced Usage

### For Developers:
- The app uses Choreographer.FrameCallback for FPS measurement
- Overlay is implemented using WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY
- Service runs as a foreground service to prevent killing

### Customization:
- Fork the repository to modify overlay appearance
- Adjust FPS calculation intervals in FPSOverlayView.kt
- Change color thresholds in the updateFPSDisplay() method
